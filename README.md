# Enderman-Head-Plus
 A better version of the Enderman Head datapack.
Download the resource pack and data pack to use.

* The data pack adds an enderman head block that powers redstone when looked at up to 16 blocks away, it also powers whatever block it is resting on.
* The signal strength is dependent on the block's distance from the closest player who looks at it.
* The block can also be worn by players and armor stands, and in all three forms will emit particles when looked at.
* Players will also recieve the "Spotted" effect while being observed.
* To use the head, place a redstone repeater at 1 tick delay followed by a redstone repeater at 4 ticks delay. This will stabilize the pulse.

The resource pack retextures an unused potion effect, "unluck", to show a player when they are being looked at. It also renames it to "spotted".
