# Enderman-Head-Plus
 A better version of the Enderman Head datapack.
Download the resource pack and data pack to use.

The data pack adds an enderman head block that powers redstone when looked at up to 16 blocks away.
The signal strength is dependent on the block's distance from the closest player who looks at it.
The block can also be worn by players and armor stands, and in all three forms will emit particles when looked at.
Players will also recieve the "Spotted" effect while being observed.

The resource pack retextures an unused potion effect, "unluck", to show a player when they are being looked at. It also renames it to "spotted".
